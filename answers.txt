Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: git is useful for source control, allowing multiple people to work on codebases, and also allows us to
check version histories, which is nice when we may need to revert to old versions. It's also nice for storing
repositories for us, which is sometimes nicer than storing it on a local machine, where we can only access it
on that specific local machine
